2022 was a huge year for D-Mo. With 6 wins and only 1 loss. No one had a better record. He's looking to continue the domination in 2023.

My legal name is Derek Morris but you could do a 4 episode 30 for 30 on all my nicknames,many of which were earned for better or worse. The most recent of which is dirt tube which has often been shortened to just "tube". Then there is old reliable , the OG, d-mo. From there the variations are endless. The following list are just some of the names bestowed upon me over the last decade. Dirt tube, tube, dirt tub, Darcy, lazy, lazy dick, d-homo, d-bitch, and bitch-mo to name a few. My golf game will not lead to any of these being improved.

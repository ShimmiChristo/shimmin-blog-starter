            Teams originally thought the 1 ball bramble would favor more to the
            blue team. This proved to be false. The Green Team won all 3 matches

            2022 introduced new faces to the cup. With those faces, came an
            array of talent. This year it was all Green Team. They came out hot
            and they rode that momentum to victory. Some may say the teams were
            uneven. Maybe Blue just played poorly and Green showed up. The
            singles matches were not a factor this year but the losses will be
            remembered for the next matchup.
          </p>
          <p>Now, go get some practice Blue team. See you next year. ðŸ’šðŸ’™</p>

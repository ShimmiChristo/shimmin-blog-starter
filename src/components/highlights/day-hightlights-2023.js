          <h3 className="h4 pt-3">Round 2.1 - Alternate Shot at The Ross</h3>
          <p>
            After a delicious lunch at Seminole Pub, we were off to the next 18
            holes. The 3rd match was alternate shot at The Ross. One player on
            each team teed off on odd numbered holes and the other, even
            numbered. The Ross is one of the most interesting courses at Boyne.
            Every hole is a replica of a variety of holes from the famous course
            designer, Donald Ross. The course has over 100 bunkers. Playing well
            will be no easy feat.

            two 7s and a 5 on the scorecard. Surprisingly, they played until
            hole 8, losing 3&2. The third match, Green ran away with it, giving{" "}

          <h3 className="h4 pt-3">Round 2.2 - Scramble at The Ross</h3>
          <p>
            Still at the Ross, the last 9 holes and the last match of the day.
            The gameplay was the Scramble format. With both players playing from
            the same spot, teams have the ability to shoot low. Before we get to
            the first match of the back nine, the second match was lost by Green
            conceding the match, losing 5&4.The third match was easily won by
            Green, 3&2. The first match was mostly close to the end. On 13, with
            an extra stroke, Green took the first point. After Blue took 15 and
            16, it came down to the last hole. Blue was up 1 with 1. Blue
            players teed off and both nearly hit both shots in the pond. Blue’s
            ball was sitting 1 foot away from the water, with just enough room
            to swing without falling in. With all 8 other players circling
            around the ball,{" "}
            <Link to="/players/evan/" className="blue underline">
              Evan
            </Link>{" "}
            took a swing… solid contact... and he stuck the green. An
            unbelievable shot with all eyes on him. After that shot, there was
            no chance to take the point for Green. Green wins 2UP.

            After day 1, Blue led 7-5.{" "}

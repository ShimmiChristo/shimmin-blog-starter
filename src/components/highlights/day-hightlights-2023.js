          <h3 className="h4 pt-3">Round 1.1 - Best Ball at Arthur Hills</h3>
          <p>
            2023 started with one best ball matches and an opening ceremony by
            the starter. With everyone standing on tee one of the hills, {dylan}{" "}
            and {cam}, {chris} and {curtis} teed off. {curtis} showed up 5
            minutes before tee time. With poor opening drives from Green,{" "}
            {dylan} and {cam} won the opening hole. They never fell behind and
            took the first point for Blue 4&3.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next two points went to Green after solid play from both teams.
            Green took a 2-1 lead after the first match.
          </p>
          <p>
            After Round 1.1, the score is:
            <br />
            <span className="block bold green">Green Team: 2</span>
            <span className="block bold blue">Blue Team: 1</span>
          </p>
          <h3 className="h4 pt-3">Round 1.2 - Two Best Ball at Arthur Hills</h3>
          <p>
            The second matches were 2 best ball. Hole 13 might be the most
            breathtaking hole in all of the Highlands. The matches started with{" "}
            {dylan} and {craig} taking a point for {chris} and {derek} and
            giving {derek} his only loss of the weekend. {dylan} beats {chris}{" "}
            again (he’s undefeated against {chris}
            ). {matt} and {travis} play well and beat {cam} and {dan}. The third
            match didn’t seem very close. {rj} and {evan} take an easy point.
          </p>
          <p>
            After 18 holes and 2 matches, the score is tied:
            <br />
            <span className="block bold green">Green Team: 3</span>
            <span className="block bold blue">Blue Team: 3</span>
          </p>

          <h3 className="h4 pt-3">Round 2.1 - Alternate Shot at The Ross</h3>
          <p>
            After a delicious lunch at Seminole Pub, we were off to the next 18
            holes. The 3rd match was alternate shot at The Ross. One player on
            each team teed off on odd numbered holes and the other, even
            numbered. The Ross is one of the most interesting courses at Boyne.
            Every hole is a replica of a variety of holes from the famous course
            designer, Donald Ross. The course has over 100 bunkers. Playing well
            will be no easy feat.
          </p>
          <p>
            {matt} and {jake} kept their match close, but couldn’t get a point
            to lose to {dylan} and {dan}. The second match was just bad golf.
            The green team put four 8s, two 7s and a 5 on the scorecard.
            Surprisingly, they played until hole 8, losing 3&2. The third match,
            Green ran away with it, giving {derek} another win and {curtis}
            ’s first and only win. Green won 4&3.
          </p>
          <p>
            After 3 matches Blue led,
            <br />
            <span className="block bold green">Green Team: 4</span>
            <span className="block bold blue">Blue Team: 5</span>
          </p>

          <h3 className="h4 pt-3">Round 2.2 - Scramble at The Ross</h3>
          <p>
            Still at the Ross, the last 9 holes and the last match of the day.
            The gameplay was the Scramble format. With both players playing from
            the same spot, teams have the ability to shoot low. Before we get to
            the first match of the back nine, the second match was lost by Green
            conceding the match, losing 5&4.The third match was easily won by
            Green, 3&2. The first match was mostly close to the end. On 13, with
            an extra stroke, Green took the first point. After Blue took 15 and
            16, it came down to the last hole. Blue was up 1 with 1. Blue
            players teed off and both nearly hit both shots in the pond. Blue’s
            ball was sitting 1 foot away from the water, with just enough room
            to swing without falling in. With all 8 other players circling
            around the ball, {evan} took a swing… solid contact... and he stuck
            the green. An unbelievable shot with all eyes on him. After that
            shot, there was no chance to take the point for Green. Green wins
            2UP.
          </p>
          <p>
            After day 1, Blue led 7-5. {dylan} went 4-0 and {chris} went 0-4.
            <br />

          <h2 className="bold h1 text-center">Day 2</h2>

          <h3 className="h4 pt-3">Round 3.1 - Bramble at The Moor</h3>
          <p>
            Day 2 started at The Moor. Probably the easiest course during the
            trip, but certainly not the least enjoyed. The front gameplay was
            Bramble, sometimes called a Shamble. With Green down 2 to start the
            day, they needed to jump out early to get back in it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first match was {matt} and {curtis} vs {craig} and Evan.
            Surprisingly, this match wasn’t close. {evan} stayed hot and his 14
            strokes on nine holes was too much to overcome for Green. Blue won
            3&2. In the second match, {chris} and {derek} jumped out to an early
            lead, 3 up through 3. It was too much for {cam} and {dan}to recover.
            Green taking a point, 3&2. Many people didn’t give {jake} and{" "}
            {travis} a chance in the third match, but they kept it close until
            the last hole. In the end the #1 and #2 players for Blue, were too
            much. Blue took another point 1UP.
          </p>
          <br />
          <span className="block bold green">Green Team: 6</span>

          <h3 className="h4 pt-3">Round 3.2 - 2 Ball Bramble at The Moor</h3>
          <p>
            Not the start Green needed for day two. Now down one more than when
            the day began, they needed to make up some ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            The back nine was a two-ball bramble. The first match was {curtis},
            {chris} vs {cam}, Evan. The fairytale story continues as {evan}{" "}
            seems unbeatable with an extra stroke a hole. {cam} and {evan} win
            2&1 and Blue takes a 4 shot lead. The third match before the second.
            Green was able to stop the bleeding, winning a very important point,
            4&2. The second match of the nine came down to the last hole. It was{" "}
            {matt} and {travis} vs {dylan} and {craig}. With every hole giving a
            point to a team, the match was all square going into the last hole.
            All four players eventually made it to the green for a putt-off.
            {dylan} putting for eagle, {matt} putting for birdie, {travis}{" "}
            putting for par, and {craig} putting for bogey. With the pressure
            on, everyone two-putted and the match ended AS.
          </p>

          <span className="block bold green">Green Team: 7.5</span>
          <span className="block bold blue">Blue Team: 10.5</span>

          <h3 className="h4 pt-3">Round 4.1 - Pinehurst at The Heather</h3>
          <p>
            The last 18 holes of the 2023 BFBH Cup were played at Boyne
            Highlands championship course, The Heather. 9 points were still
            available for the taking. Blue needed 3.5 more points to take the
            cup and Green needed 6 points to keep the cup. Remember, a tie goes
            to the previous year’s winner. Green won in 2022, so if it ends 13.5
            to 13.5, then they retain the cup. Green needed to win 6 of the
            remaining points.
          </p>
          <p>
            The front nine was a new game format, Pinehurst. For the first time
            all weekend, the players would play against the same players for all
            18 holes. The first match was {curtis} and {derek} vs {evan} and
            Dan. That match went down to the wire. Green won the last hole and
            pushed the match. The second match was {jake} and {travis} vs{" "}
            {craig} and {cam}. Green got the better of Blue and won on the last
            hole. The third and final match was Blue team captain, {dylan}, and{" "}
            {rj} vs Green team captain, {matt}, and {chris}. With all the stakes
            on the line, this was one of the most competitive matches of the
            weekend. Down 1 with 1 to play,
            {matt} and {chris} won the last hole to push the match.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the Pinehurst matches, Green gains 1 point on Blue. Blue leads
            Green 11.5-9.5.
          </p>
          <br />
          <span className="block bold green">Green Team: 9.5</span>
          <span className="block bold blue">Blue Team: 11.5</span>

          <h3 className="h4 pt-3">Round 4.2 - Singles at The Heather</h3>
          <p>
            This is it ladies and gentlemen. It came down to the last nine
            holes. Blue needed 2.5 points and Green needed 4 points to win. The
            Heather was slowed down by a roundy group in front of our players
            and we were pushing daylight. By the end of the cup, the sun was set
            for at least 30 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first match, {derek} vs Dan. {derek} was on fire all weekend.
            {dan} didn’t stand a chance. {derek} won 5&4.{" "}
            <span className="bold blue">Blue 11.5</span>,{" "}
            <span className="bold green">Green 10.5</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next match to end was {jake} vs {craig}. {craig} got a stroke
            against
            {jake} (questionable) and he took advantage of it. {craig} won 2&1
            on hole 8. <span className="bold blue">Blue 12.5</span>,{" "}
            <span className="bold green">Green 10.5</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next match to finish was {chris} vs RJ. Surprisingly, this match
            ended earlier than we all expected. In the end, the bunkers won.
            {chris} won 3&2. <span className="bold blue">Blue 12.5</span>,{" "}
            <span className="bold green">Green 11.5</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next to finish was {matt} vs {dylan}. On hole 13, we were hitting
            into the sun. After thinking he had a great shot, we found {dylan}{" "}
            in the rough without a shot at the green. {dylan} ended up losing
            the hole and losing his composure. {matt} would win 13, 14 and 15.
            After the push on 17, it was over 2&1, Green team.{" "}
            <span className="bold blue">Blue 12.5</span>,{" "}
            <span className="bold green">Green 12.5</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two groups played the 18th hole. {curtis} vs {evan} and {travis} vs
            {cam}.
          </p>
          <p>
            Going into the 18th hole, {evan}vs {curtis}. {evan} was up 1 and he
            took care of business after {curtis} went into the water. {evan} won
            for the 6th time. <span className="bold blue">Green 13.5</span>,{" "}
            <span className="bold green">Green 12.5</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It all came down to the final match. {travis} vs {cam}. {travis} is
            up 1. All {travis} needs to do is tie against {cam} on the hole and
            Green wins the cup. The 18th hole is one of the hardest holes on all
            of Boyne’s property. The second shot is a 180 yard shot over water
            to a green. {cam} tees off with an iron to play it safe. He duffs it
            right, about 50 yards. {travis}
            ’s tee shot is a hook left into the weeds. {cam}’s second shot is a
            duck hook left, down a hill to hole 10. {travis} takes a drop and
            hits it into the water. Takes another drop and hits back into the
            water. {cam} hits on the green. {travis} concedes the hole, ending
            the match in a push and giving Blue the 1/2 point they needed. Blue
            wins the 2023 BFBH Cup.

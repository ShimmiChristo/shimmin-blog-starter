      <p>
        2022 marks the second year of the BFBH Cup. Blue team retains the cup
        and the green team must win by at least 1/2 point to win the cup.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2022, the teams are expanding in size to 6 players, instead of 4.
        This means there are 27 points available with 14 points required to win
        the cup.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each team has returning team captains, Dylan Wells leading the blue team
        and Matt Gruesbeck leading the green team.

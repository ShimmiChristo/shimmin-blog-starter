      <h2>2023 Match</h2>
      <p>
        Going into 2023, we were expecting the closest score yet. We kept most
        scores all year long and we were confident in our golfers handicaps.
        With that being said, we still didn’t have every scorecard so it wasn’t
        a perfect system.
      </p>
      <p>
        2023 also introduces a new gameplay, Pinehurst. Both players tee off,
        then they play each other’s ball, then play alternate from there. This
        format was a big hit amongst the players. This will continue to be a
        format going forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        A major highlight of the weekend was the stay. Boyne Highlands is the
        best bang for buck that resort golf has to offer in Michigan. The
        breakfast, the lodging, the hot tub pool, and of course some of the top
        golf courses in the state. We enjoyed it so much, we already booked our
        stay at Boyne for 2024! That’s right, we’re running it back! This time,
        however, we’re Bay Harbor will be included in the 2024 Cup.
      </p>
      <h2>Day 1</h2>
      <p>
        2023 started with one best ball matches and an opening ceremony by the
        starter. With everyone standing on tee one of the hills, {dylan} and{" "}
        {cam}, {chris} and {curtis} teed off. {curtis} showed up 5 minutes
        before tee time. With poor opening drives from Green, {dylan} and {cam}{" "}
        won the opening hole. They never fell behind and took the first point
        for Blue 4&3. The next two points went to Green after solid play from
        both teams. Green took a 2-1 lead after the first match.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second matches were 2 best ball. Hole 13 might be the most
        breathtaking hole in all of the Highlands. The matches started with
        {dylan} and {craig} taking a point for {chris} and {derek} and giving{" "}
        {derek}
        his only loss of the weekend. {dylan} beats {chris} again (he’s
        undefeated against {chris}). {matt} and {travis} play well and beat{" "}
        {cam} and {dan}. The third match didn’t seem very close. {rj} and {evan}{" "}
        take an easy point.
      </p>

        take an easy point.
      </p>
      <p>After 18 holes and 2 matches, the Cup is tied 3-3.</p>
      <p>
        After a delicious lunch at Seminole Pub, we were off to the next 18
        holes. The 3rd match was alternate shot at The Ross. One player on each
        team teed off on odd numbered holes and the other, even numbered. The
        Ross is one of the most interesting courses at Boyne. Every hole is a
        replica of a variety of holes from the famous course designer, Donald
        Ross. The course has over 100 bunkers. Playing well will be no easy
        feat.
      </p>
      <p>
        {matt} and {jake} kept their match close, but couldn’t get a point to
        lose to {dylan} and {dan}. The second match was just bad golf. The green
        team put four 8s, two 7s and a 5 on the scorecard. Surprisingly, they
        played until hole 8, losing 3&2. The third match, Green ran away with
        it, giving {derek} another win and {curtis}’s first and only win. Green
        won 4&3.
      </p>
      <p>After 3 matches, Blue led 5-4.</p>
      <p>
        Still at the Ross, the last 9 holes and the last match of the day. The
        gameplay was the Scramble format. With both players playing from the
        same spot, teams have the ability to shoot low. Before we get to the
        first match of the back nine, the second match was lost by Green
        conceding the match, losing 5&4.The third match was easily won by Green,
        3&2. The first match was mostly close to the end. On 13, with an extra
        stroke, Green took the first point. After Blue took 15 and 16, it came
        down to the last hole. Blue was up 1 with 1. Blue players teed off and
        both nearly hit both shots in the pond. Blue’s ball was sitting 1 foot
        away from the water, with just enough room to swing without falling in.
        With all 8 other players circling around the ball, {evan} took a swing…
        solid contact... and he stuck the green. An unbelievable shot with all
        eyes on him. After that shot, there was no chance to take the point for
        Green. Green wins 2UP.
      </p>
      <p>
        After day 1, Blue leads 7-5. {dylan} goes 4-0, {chris} goes 0-4.
      </p>
      <h2>Day 2</h2>
      <p>
        Day 2 started at The Moor. Probably the easiest course during the trip,
        but certainly not the least enjoyed. The front gameplay was Bramble,
        sometimes called a Shamble. With Green down 2 to start the day, they
        needed to jump out early to get back in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first match was {matt} and {curtis} vs {craig} and {evan}.
        Surprisingly, this match wasn’t close. {evan} stayed hot and his 14
        strokes on nine holes was too much to overcome for Green. Blue won 3&2.
        In the second match, {chris} and {derek} jumped out to an early lead, 3
        up through 3. It was too much for {cam} and {dan} to recover. Green
        taking a point, 3&2. Many people didn’t give {jake} and {travis} a
        chance in the third match, but they kept it close until the last hole.
        In the end the #1 and #2 players for Blue, were too much. Blue took
        another point 1UP.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Not the start Green needed for day two. Now down one more than when the
        day began, they needed to make up some ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        The back nine was a two-ball bramble. The first match was {curtis},{" "}
        {chris}
        vs {cam}, {evan}. The fairytale story continues as {evan} seems
        unbeatable with an extra stroke a hole. {cam} and {evan} win 2&1 and
        Blue takes a 4 shot lead. The third match before the second. Green was
        able to stop the bleeding, winning a very important point, 4&2. The
        second match of the nine came down to the last hole. It was {matt} and{" "}
        {travis} vs {dylan} and
        {craig}. With every hole giving a point to a team, the match was all
        square going into the last hole. All four players eventually made it to
        the green for a putt-off. {dylan} putting for eagle, {matt} putting for
        birdie, {travis} putting for par, and {craig} putting for bogey. With
        the pressure on, everyone two-putted and the match ended AS.
      </p>
      <p>After the third round, Blue was leading, 10.5-7.5.</p>
      <p>
        The last 18 holes of the 2023 BFBH Cup were played at Boyne Highlands
        championship course, The Heather. 9 points were still available for the
        taking. Blue needed 3.5 more points to take the cup and Green needed 6
        points to keep the cup. Remember, a tie goes to the previous year’s
        winner. Green won in 2022, so if it ends 13.5 to 13.5, then they retain
        the cup. Green needed to win 6 of the remaining points.
      </p>
      <p>
        The front nine was a new game format, Pinehurst. For the first time all
        weekend, the players would play against the same players for all 18
        holes. The first match was {curtis} and {derek} vs {evan} and {dan}.
        That match went down to the wire. Green won the last hole and pushed the
        match. The second match was {jake} and {travis} vs {craig} and {cam}.
        Green got the better of Blue and won on the last hole. The third and
        final match was Blue team captain, {dylan}, and {rj} vs Green team
        captain, {matt}, and {chris}. With all the stakes on the line, this was
        one of the most competitive matches of the weekend. Down 1 with 1 to
        play, {matt} and {chris} won the last hole to push the match.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the Pinehurst matches, Green gains 1 point on Blue. Blue leads
        Green 11.5-9.5.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is it ladies and gentlemen. It came down to the last nine holes.
        Blue needed 2.5 points and Green needed 4 points to win. The Heather was
        slowed down by a rowdy group in front of our players and we were pushing
        daylight. By the end of the cup, the sun was set for at least 30
        minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first match, {derek} vs {dan}. {derek} was on fire all weekend.{" "}
        {dan} didn’t stand a chance. {derek} won 5&4. Blue 11.5, Green 10.5.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next match to end was {jake} vs {craig}. {craig} got a stroke
        against
        {jake} (questionable) and he took advantage of it. {craig} won 2&1 on
        hole 8. Blue 12.5, Green 10.5.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next match to finish was {chris} vs {rj}. Surprisingly, this match
        ended earlier than we all expected. In the end, the bunkers won. {chris}{" "}
        won 3&2. Blue 12.5, Green 11.5.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next to finish was {matt} vs {dylan}. On hole 13, we were hitting into
        the sun. After thinking he had a great shot, we found {dylan} in the
        rough without a shot at the green. {dylan} ended up losing the hole and
        losing his composure. {matt} would win 13, 14 and 15. After the push on
        17, it was over 2&1, Green team. Blue 12.5, Green 12.5.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two groups played the 18th hole. {curtis} vs {evan} and {travis} vs{" "}
        {cam}.
      </p>
      <p>
        Going into the 18th hole, {evan} vs {curtis}. {evan} was up 1 and he
        took care of business after {curtis} went into the water. {evan} won for
        the 6th time. Blue 13.5, Green 12.5.
      </p>
      <p>
        It all came down to the final match. {travis} vs {cam}. {travis} is up
        1. All {travis} needs to do is tie against {cam} on the hole and Green
        wins the cup. The 18th hole is one of the hardest holes on all of
        Boyne’s property. The second shot is a 180 yard shot over water to a
        green. {cam}
        tees off with an iron to play it safe. He duffs it right, about 50
        yards. {travis}’s tee shot is a hook left into the weeds. {cam}’s second
        shot is a duck hook left, down a hill to hole 10. {travis} takes a drop
        and hits it into the water. Takes a drop and hits back into the water.
        {cam} hits on the green. {travis} concedes and the match ends in a push.
        Blue wins the 2023 BFBH cup 14 points to 13 points.

      <h2>2023 Match</h2>
      <h2>Day 1</h2>
      <p>
        2023 started with one best ball matches and an opening ceremony by the
        starter. With everyone standing on tee one of the hills, Dylan and Cam,
        Chris and Curtis teed off. Curtis showed up 5 minutes before tee time.
        With poor opening drives from Green, Dylan and Cam won the opening hole.
        They never fell behind and took the first point for Blue 4&3. The next
        two points went to Green after solid play from both teams. Green took a
        2-1 lead after the first match.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second matches were 2 best ball. Hole 13 might be the most
        breathtaking hole in all of the Highlands. The matches started with
        Dylan and Craig taking a point for Chris and Derek and giving Derek his
        only loss of the weekend. Dylan beats Chris again (he’s undefeated
        against Chris). Matt and Travis play well and beat Cam and Dan. The
        third match didn’t seem very close. RJ and Evan take an easy point.

      <p>After 18 holes and 2 matches, the Cup is tied 3-3.</p>
      <p>
        After a delicious lunch at Seminole Pub, we were off to the next 18
        holes. The 3rd match was alternate shot at The Ross. One player on each
        team teed off on odd numbered holes and the other, even numbered. The
        Ross is one of the most interesting courses at Boyne. Every hole is a
        replica of a variety of holes from the famous course designer, Donald
        Ross. The course has over 100 bunkers. Playing well will be no easy
        feat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Matt and Jake kept their match close, but couldn’t get a point to lose
        to Dylan and Dan. The second match was just bad golf. The green team put
        four 8s, two 7s and a 5 on the scorecard. Surprisingly, they played
        until hole 8, losing 3&2. The third match, Green ran away with it,
        giving Derek another win and Curtis’s first and only win. Green won 4&3.
      </p>
      <p>After 3 matches, Blue led 5-4.</p>
      <p>
        Still at the Ross, the last 9 holes and the last match of the day. The
        gameplay was the Scramble format. With both players playing from the
        same spot, teams have the ability to shoot low. Before we get to the
        first match of the back nine, the second match was lost by Green
        conceding the match, losing 5&4.The third match was easily won by Green,
        3&2. The first match was mostly close to the end. On 13, with an extra
        stroke, Green took the first point. After Blue took 15 and 16, it came
        down to the last hole. Blue was up 1 with 1. Blue players teed off and
        both nearly hit both shots in the pond. Blue’s ball was sitting 1 foot
        away from the water, with just enough room to swing without falling in.
        With all 8 other players circling around the ball, Evan took a swing…
        solid contact... and he stuck the green. An unbelievable shot with all
        eyes on him. After that shot, there was no chance to take the point for
        Green. Green wins 2UP.
      </p>
      <p>After day 1, Blue leads 7-5. Dylan goes 4-0, Chris goes 0-4.</p>

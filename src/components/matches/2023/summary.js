      <h2>2023 Match</h2>
      <p>
        Going into 2023, we were expecting the closest score yet. We kept most
        scores all year long and we were confident in our golfers handicaps.
        With that being said, we still didn’t have every scorecard so it wasn’t
        a perfect system.
      </p>
      <p>
        2023 also introduces a new gameplay, Pinehurst. Both players tee off,
        then they play each other’s ball, then play alternate from there. This
        format was a big hit amongst the players. This will continue to be a
        format going forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        A major highlight of the weekend was the stay. Boyne Highlands is the
        best bang for buck that resort golf has to offer in Michigan. The
        breakfast, the lodging, the hottub pool, and of course some of the top
        golf courses in the state. We enjoyed it so much, we already booked our
        stay at Boyne for 2024! That’s right, we’re running it back! This time,
        however, we’re Bay Harbor will be included in the 2024 Cup.
      </p>
      <h2>Day 1</h2>
      <p>
        2023 started with one best ball matches and an opening ceremony by the
        starter. With everyone standing on tee one of the hills, Dylan and Cam,
        Chris and Curtis teed off. Curtis showed up 5 minutes before tee time.
        With poor opening drives from Green, Dylan and Cam won the opening hole.
        They never fell behind and took the first point for Blue 4&3. The next
        two points went to Green after solid play from both teams. Green took a
        2-1 lead after the first match.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second matches were 2 best ball. Hole 13 might be the most
        breathtaking hole in all of the Highlands. The matches started with
        Dylan and Craig taking a point for Chris and Derek and giving Derek his
        only loss of the weekend. Dylan beats Chris again (he’s undefeated
        against Chris). Matt and Travis play well and beat Cam and Dan. The
        third match didn’t seem very close. RJ and Evan take an easy point.

      </p>
      <p>After 18 holes and 2 matches, the Cup is tied 3-3.</p>
      <p>
        After a delicious lunch at Seminole Pub, we were off to the next 18
        holes. The 3rd match was alternate shot at The Ross. One player on each
        team teed off on odd numbered holes and the other, even numbered. The
        Ross is one of the most interesting courses at Boyne. Every hole is a
        replica of a variety of holes from the famous course designer, Donald
        Ross. The course has over 100 bunkers. Playing well will be no easy
        feat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Matt and Jake kept their match close, but couldn’t get a point to lose
        to Dylan and Dan. The second match was just bad golf. The green team put
        four 8s, two 7s and a 5 on the scorecard. Surprisingly, they played
        until hole 8, losing 3&2. The third match, Green ran away with it,
        giving Derek another win and Curtis’s first and only win. Green won 4&3.
      </p>
      <p>After 3 matches, Blue led 5-4.</p>
      <p>
        Still at the Ross, the last 9 holes and the last match of the day. The
        gameplay was the Scramble format. With both players playing from the
        same spot, teams have the ability to shoot low. Before we get to the
        first match of the back nine, the second match was lost by Green
        conceding the match, losing 5&4.The third match was easily won by Green,
        3&2. The first match was mostly close to the end. On 13, with an extra
        stroke, Green took the first point. After Blue took 15 and 16, it came
        down to the last hole. Blue was up 1 with 1. Blue players teed off and
        both nearly hit both shots in the pond. Blue’s ball was sitting 1 foot
        away from the water, with just enough room to swing without falling in.
        With all 8 other players circling around the ball, Evan took a swing…
        solid contact... and he stuck the green. An unbelievable shot with all
        eyes on him. After that shot, there was no chance to take the point for
        Green. Green wins 2UP.
      </p>
      <p>After day 1, Blue leads 7-5. Dylan goes 4-0, Chris goes 0-4.</p>
      <h2>Day 2</h2>
      <p>
        Day 2 started at The Moor. Probably the easiest course during the trip,
        but certainly not the least enjoyed. The front gameplay was Bramble,
        sometimes called a Shamble. With Green down 2 to start the day, they
        needed to jump out early to get back in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first match was Matt and Curtis vs Craig and Evan. Surprisingly,
        this match wasn’t close. Evan stayed hot and his 14 strokes on nine
        holes was too much to overcome for Green. Blue won 3&2. In the second
        match, Chris and Derek jumped out to an early lead, 3 up through 3. It
        was too much for Cam and Dan to recover. Green taking a point, 3&2. Many
        people didn’t give Jake and Travis a chance in the third match, but they
        kept it close until the last hole. In the end the #1 and #2 players for
        Blue, were too much. Blue took another point 1UP.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Not the start Green needed for day two. Now down one more than when the
        day began, they needed to make up some ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        The back nine was a two-ball bramble. The first match was Curtis, Chris
        vs Cam, Evan. The fairytale story continues as Evan seems unbeatable
        with an extra stroke a hole. Cam and Evan win 2&1 and Blue takes a 4
        shot lead. The third match before the second. Green was able to stop the
        bleeding, winning a very important point, 4&2. The second match of the
        nine came down to the last hole. It was Matt and Travis vs Dylan and
        Craig. With every hole giving a point to a team, the match was all
        square going into the last hole. All four players eventually made it to
        the green for a putt-off. Dylan putting for eagle, Matt putting for
        birdie, Travis putting for par, and Craig putting for bogey. With the
        pressure on, everyone two-putted and the match ended AS.
      </p>
      <p>After the third round, Blue was leading, 10.5-7.5.</p>
      <p>
        The last 18 holes of the 2023 BFBH Cup were played at Boyne Highlands
        championship course, The Heather. 9 points were still available for the
        taking. Blue needed 3.5 more points to take the cup and Green needed 6
        points to keep the cup. Remember, a tie goes to the previous year’s
        winner. Green won in 2022, so if it ends 13.5 to 13.5, then they retain
        the cup. Green needed to win 6 of the remaining points.
      </p>
      <p>
        The front nine was a new game format, Pinehurst. For the first time all
        weekend, the players would play against the same players for all 18
        holes. The first match was Curtis and Derek vs Evan and Dan. That match
        went down to the wire. Green won the last hole and pushed the match. The
        second match was Jake and Travis vs Craig and Cam. Green got the better
        of Blue and won on the last hole. The third and final match was Blue
        team captain, Dylan, and RJ vs Green team captain, Matt, and Chris. With
        all the stakes on the line, this was one of the most competitive matches
        of the weekend. Down 1 with 1 to play, Matt and Chris won the last hole
        to push the match.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the Pinehurst matches, Green gains 1 point on Blue. Blue leads
        Green 11.5-9.5.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is it ladies and gentlemen. It came down to the last nine holes.
        Blue needed 2.5 points and Green needed 4 points to win. The Heather was
        slowed down by a roundy group in front of our players and we were
        pushing daylight. By the end of the cup, the sun was set for at least 30
        minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first match, Derek vs Dan. Derek was on fire all weekend. Dan didn’t
        stand a chance. Derek won 5&4. Blue 11.5, Green 10.5.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next match to end was Jake vs Craig. Craig got a stroke against Jake
        (questionable) and he took advantage of it. Craig won 2&1 on hole 8.
        Blue 12.5, Green 10.5.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next match to finish was Chris vs RJ. Surprisingly, this match ended
        earlier than we all expected. In the end, the bunkers won. Chris won
        3&2. Blue 12.5, Green 11.5.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next to finish was Matt vs Dylan. On hole 13, we were hitting into the
        sun. After thinking he had a great shot, we found Dylan in the rough
        without a shot at the green. Dylan ended up losing the hole and losing
        his composure. Matt would win 13, 14 and 15. After the push on 17, it
        was over 2&1, Green team. Blue 12.5, Green 12.5.
      </p>
      <p>Two groups played the 18th hole. Curtis vs Evan and Travis vs Cam.</p>
      <p>
        Going into the 18th hole, Evan vs Curtis. Evan was up 1 and he took care
        of business after Curtis went into the water. Evan won for the 6th time.
        Blue 13.5, Green 12.5.
      </p>
      <p>
        It all came down to the final match. Travis vs Cam. Travis is up 1. All
        Travis needs to do is tie against Cam on the hole and Green wins the
        cup. The 18th hole is one of the hardest holes on all of Boyne’s
        property. The second shot is a 180 yard shot over water to a green. Cam
        tees off with an iron to play it safe. He duffs it right, about 50
        yards. Travis’s tee shot is a hook left into the weeds. Cam’s second
        shot is a duck hook left, down a hill to hole 10. Travis takes a drop
        and hits it into the water. Takes a drop and hits back into the water.
        Cam hits on the green. Travis concedes and the match ends in a push.
        Blue wins the 2023 BFBH cup 14 points to 13 points.

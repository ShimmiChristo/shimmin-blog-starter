      <h2>2021 Match</h2>
      <p>
        2021 marked the first official year of the BFBH Cup. Lead by the blue
        team captain and commissioner{" "}

        In the last beautiful fall days in Northern Michigan, 14 points were
        available for the taking. In 2 days, 3 rounds of golf were played. Each
        round was broken into 9 hole matches in a variety of games and
        competition.
      </p>
      <p>
        This year started with Dan and Derek playing 9 holes the day before
        because of a day two time crunch, they tied, starting the score off with
        0.5 to 0.5. On the official day 1, the blue team took a commanding lead
        right out of gate, winning the first 4 games outright and starting with
        a 4.5-0.5 lead. The blue team continued their dominance on day 1 with
        2.5 more points. After day 1, the score was blue team 7, green team 2.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heading into the final day and the singles matches left to play, the
        best green team could do was tie. There were 5 points left on the table.
        The green team scored 2 points on the first 9 holes, making the score
        7-4. Heading into the singles matches, green had to win each one
        outright. This is where the comeback story ends, in the end, the blue
        team was too much, winning 2 of the last 3 points on the back 9 holes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The blue team defeated the green team 9 to 5, holding cup for the first
        year.
